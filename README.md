## Tools

[LabVIEW FPGA](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/software/products/labview-fpga-module.html) is a software add-on for LabVIEW that you can use to more efficiently and effectively design FPGA-based systems through a highly integrated development environment, IP libraries, a high-fidelity simulator, and debugging features.

[Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) is a multiplatform toolbox, with static pre-built packages, project configuration tools and easy command interface to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload your verilog designs.

[IceStorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm) is a project that aims at documenting the bitstream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bitstream files.

[Icestudio](https://icestudio.io/) is a visual editor for open FPGA boards. Built on top of the Icestorm project using Apio.

[FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) is an award-winning package manager and a set of build tools for HDL (Hardware Description Language) code and FPGA/ASIC development.
